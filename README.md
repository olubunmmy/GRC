##  Continuous Compliance Monitoring with Qualys Policy Compliance & Cloud Agent Sensor


---

##  Project Overview

This project showcases my practical experience with the **Qualys Policy Compliance (PC)** platform. It demonstrates my ability to automate compliance verification and remediation processes using industry standards and custom configurations. I deployed **Qualys Cloud Agent Sensors** to onboard hosts and implemented policies that continuously assess system configurations against defined security benchmarks.

Through hands-on application of the platform, I explored the full lifecycle of compliance monitoring—from asset registration and control configuration to scan execution and compliance reporting. These actions were guided by structured learning outcomes from a Qualys training module, which emphasized real-world scenarios and industry-aligned practices.

- Used UDCs to tailor policy enforcement to specific organizational needs

### 4. **Policy Creation**
- Built policies using:
  - Predefined compliance templates
  - Custom UDCs for specialized checks
- Assigned policies to tagged asset groups

### 5. **Authentication Record Configuration**
- Configured credentialed scanning by setting up:
  - Windows authentication records
  - Linux authentication records

### 6. **Compliance Scan Execution**
- Launched scans via Cloud Agents for continuous monitoring
- Analyzed scan results in the dashboard

### 7. **Compliance Reporting**
- Constructed detailed compliance reports
- Included pass/fail summaries, remediation guidance, and control-level analysis

### 8. **Evaluation & Remediation**
- Assessed scan effectiveness and applied recommended remediations
- Retested for compliance improvements
